        - Accounting Intern</u></div>

      <div class="internship-description">Processed payments with high attention
        to accuracy and detail using QuickBooks
        software, served as the sole accountant for the Spirit 2022 fireworks
        tent. Created accurate financial documents,
        analyzed reports for the finance director, and conducted inventory
        audits to improve accuracy and efficiency.
        Provided data-driven recommendations for order quantity and pricing of
        tent products.

      <div class="subheading lg-3 fw-semibold text-center"><u>What did I learn?</u></div>
      <div class="learned-content mx-2">Overall, my internship at Spirit of '76
        Fireworks provided me with valuable hands-on experience in the
        day-to-day financial processes and operations. Collaborating closely
        with the Tent Manager, we focused on optimizing orders, minimizing labor
        costs, and maximizing revenue. By meticulously pricing items and
        continuously tracking and analyzing sales data, I ensured that our
        revenue and associated profit consistently exceeded our goals.
        <br>
        <br>
        Throughout the selling period, my diligent tracking and auditing efforts
        helped identify errors and corrections, allowing for timely adjustments
        and ensuring precision and accuracy in our financial reports. The daily
        and weekly audits were instrumental in maintaining the integrity of our
        financial data.
        <br>
        <br>
        As the internship drew to a close, I took on the responsibility of
        creating a comprehensive final report that encapsulated our
        achievements. With confidence, I presented this report to the ownership
        and executive-level management, highlighting the significant increase in
        sales and profit that our pricing and inventory optimization strategies
        had achieved, boasting double-digit growth.
        <br>
        <br>
        By successfully contributing to the financial success of the project, I
        not only honed my skills in financial analysis and reporting but also
        gained a deeper understanding of the importance of collaboration,
        attention to detail, and adaptability in a dynamic business environment.
        I am grateful for the opportunity to have played a part in driving the
        growth and profitability of Spirit of '76 Fireworks.<br> <br>

      <div class="learned-content mx-2">
        My internship with the IT deskside team at Veterans United Home Loans
        was a transformative experience. I had the opportunity to work on
        various projects that allowed me to enhance my technical skills and
        broaden my knowledge of the industry. One project involved deploying and
        configuring computers for employees, where I gained hands-on experience
        with hardware setup, software installation, and troubleshooting.
        Additionally, I provided technical support to end-users, assisting them
        with hardware and software issues, network connectivity, and IT system
        navigation. These experiences taught me the importance of
        problem-solving and customer service in an IT support role.
        <br>
        <br>
        Collaborating with the IT team on system upgrades and maintenance tasks
        was another highlight of my internship. I learned how to perform
        software updates, ensure data backups, and monitor the overall health
        and performance of the IT infrastructure. This exposure gave me insight
        into the critical role IT plays in supporting an organization's
        operations and the significance of regular maintenance and monitoring
        <br>
        <br>
        What made this internship truly exceptional was the incredible team at
        Veterans United Home Loans. Working alongside talented, hardworking, and
        supportive individuals was a privilege. They provided guidance and
        mentorship, fostering an environment of open communication and
        collaboration. I was encouraged to ask questions and seek help whenever
        needed, accelerating my learning and making the experience the perfect
        experience for me.
