        <h2>What am I looking for in a company?</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I am looking for a company with a few different qualities.</p>
        <ul></ul>
        <p><strong><u>Professional development</u></strong>  -  I am passionate about learning and 
          will always strive to learn new things. I want to find a company that is willing
          to take advantage of the passion I have for learning how to process, optimize, or understand problems.
       </p>
        <p><strong><u>Sense of purpose</u></strong>  -  I want to feel like I am important to an organization. I want to come in and meet
          with fellow teams that communicate their ideas and provide a fourm for me to discuss
          potential directions with a team.
       </p>

        <p><strong><u>Data driven</u></strong>  -  I have a niche love of data, econoimcs, and finance. It
          is undoubtedly a strange combination but roles at the intersection of finance and technology
          are the perfect solution.
       </p>

        <p><Strong><u>Mission focused</u></Strong>  -  I want to work for a company that works for good. Companies often take advantage of
           their community instead of reinvesting into it. I want to work for companies that show
           they take care of their employees and community.

      <section id="about-me">
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I received two degrees, both from the University of Missouri, a
          Bachelors of Science in Business Administration: Finance and Banking
          and a Bachelors of Science in Economics from the University Missouri -
          Columbia colleges of Business and Arts & Sciences.</p>
        <p>I am a lifelong learner. Even though my college education has
          completed, I am looking for additional professional development
          opportunities!</p>
        <p>I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual. I am a team
          player and I am always willing to dig a bit further to reveal new
          truths.</p>
