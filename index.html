      <div class="col-xxxl-11 themed-grid-col work-content mt-3" id="about-me">
        <h2 class="text-center">Education</h2>
        <p>I received two degrees, both from the University of Missouri, a
          Bachelors of Science in Business Administration: Finance and Banking
          and a Bachelors of Science in Economics from the University Missouri -
          Columbia colleges of Business and Arts & Sciences.</p>
        <p>I am a lifelong learner. Even though my college education has
          completed, I am looking for additional professional development
          opportunities!</p>
        <p>I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual. I am a team
          player and I am always willing to dig a bit further to reveal new
          truths.</p>

        <div class="container-xxxl-11 themed-grid-col work-content mt-3">
          <h2 class="text-center">What am I looking for in a company?</h2>
          <p>Hi there! I am looking for a company with a few different
            qualities.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Professional development</u></strong> - I am passionate
            about learning and
            will always strive to learn new things. I want to find a company
            that is willing
            to take advantage of the passion I have for learning how to process,
            optimize, or understand problems.
          </p>
          <p><strong><u>Sense of purpose</u></strong> - I want to feel like I am
            important to an organization. I want to come in and meet
            with fellow teams that communicate their ideas and provide a fourm
            for me to discuss
            potential directions with a team.
          </p>

          <p><strong><u>Data driven</u></strong> - I have a niche love of data,
            econoimcs, and finance. It
            is undoubtedly a strange combination but roles at the intersection
            of finance and technology
            are the perfect solution.
          </p>

          <p><strong><u>Mission focused</u></strong> - I want to work for a
            company that works for good. Companies often take advantage of
            their community instead of reinvesting into it. I want to work for
            companies that show
            they take care of their employees and community.

            id="my-work">
            <h2 class="text-center">Internships</h2>
            <p>I have worked as an accounting intern for Spirit of '76
              fireworks, a
              leading fireworks manufacturer and distributor. This experience
              gave me hands-on
              experience working with financial planning and reporting.</p>
            <p>I have also worked as an IT intern with Veterans United Home
              Loans, the largest VA loan
              provider by volume in the United States. I enhanced my customer
              service and teamwork skills, and
              further deepened my love for technology.
