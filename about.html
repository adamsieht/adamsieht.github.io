        <h5>What's the problem?</h5>
        <p>I've been playing Clash of Clans since its release over ten years ago, and I must admit, it makes me feel
          super old. One significant addition to the game was the introduction of the Builder Base in October 17.
          Supercell eventually added an additional builder who could travel between both bases. This was a game-changer
          because builders are incredibly valuable and having an extra one allows players to progress through the game a
          whopping 20% faster. <br> However, the journey to unlock the next builder through the builder base was quite
          an arduous one. Many players found it long, boring, and downright exhausting. It wasn't exactly the most
          enjoyable aspect of the game. Despite that, some of us realized that the reward of unlocking the sixth builder
          for free made it all worth it. It required patience and dedication, but in the end, the benefits outweighed
          the tedium.</p>
        <p>To obtain the O.T.T.O. hut, I had to go through a series of steps in my home base. First, I had to "gear up"
          three buildings, upgrade the cannon cart to level 18, the mega tesla to level 9, and the battlemachine to
          level 30. At first glance, it didn't seem too challenging, but, was I wrong.</p>
        <p>The real struggle came from
          the scarcity of resources in the builder base. Sure, there were a few collectors to contribute to my progress,
          but the bulk of the resources had to be earned through victorious attacks. To maximize my resource gain, I had
          to win three attacks every day. The rewards from battles varied depending on the trophy count of my opponents.
          This meant that I had to actively engage in the game and constantly strive to improve my skills to progress
          through the base effectively. It required dedication and active play to keep the resources flowing.</p>
        <p>In Clash of Clans, planning plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient resource management and optimal use of
          builders. Many players, including myself, rely on tools like <a href="https://www.clash.ninja/">Clash
            Ninja</a> to plan and strategize the allocation of our resources. However, I noticed that Clash Ninja lacked
          a robust system for tracking the completion progress of the builder base. This realization motivated me to
          take matters into my own hands and develop a tool that would provide a clear understanding of how much further
          I needed to progress in order to unlock the desired features.
        </p>
        <h4>So what can I do about it?</h4>
        <p>During that time, I was a Junior in college, and I had already taken several classes that taught us how to
          utilize Excel effectively. It was in line with this website project that I embarked on a journey to gain a
          deeper understanding of various tools that I would encounter in my future endeavors. I decided to challenge
          myself by creating a calculator specifically designed to estimate the time required for completing the builder
          hut in Clash of Clans. The <a href="https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clash_of_Clans_Wiki">Clash of Clans
            Wiki</a>.
          To start off, I began gathering the necessary data from a community website called <a
            href="https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clash_of_Clans_Wiki">Clash of Clans Wiki</a>. This
          valuable resource provided comprehensive data tables containing the cost and duration for each upgrade in the
          game. Armed with this information, I was ready to dive into the development process of my calculator.</p>
        <p>A significant portion of my time was dedicated to cleaning the data I gathered and ensuring that the values
          were correctly set to their respective units. Time, for instance, had different formats depending on the
          duration of the upgrades. Shorter upgrades were measured in minutes, while longer ones required a combination
          of days and hours.</p>
        <p>To create a user-friendly interface, I utilized Excel's VLookup tools to implement dropdown menus for users
          to select their current upgrade levels. This system also enabled me to reference the data tables and
          incorporate them into the formulas. This aspect of the project was the most challenging and required
          thoughtful consideration. Once players made their selections, various cells would dynamically change,
          displaying information such as the next upgrade's cost, the time required to complete it, and the cumulative
          time and resources necessary to upgrade the building to the required level for the challenge.</p>
        <h5>What research did you do?</h5>
        <p>I wanted this project to be community-driven because I recognized that I was not alone in my frustration. I
          believed that empowering players with a better understanding of the time commitment required for the challenge
          would help them overcome it. The frustration stemmed not only from the challenge itself but primarily from the
          uncertainty surrounding its duration. One player aptly compared it to the frustration of waiting in an
          emergency room without knowing how long it will take to be seen, and described it as an agonizing experience.
        </p>
        <h5>Who uses this tool?</h5>
        <p>In my quest to create a useful tool for calculating the time needed to complete the builder hut challenge in
          Clash of Clans, I reached out to the Clash of Clans Reddit community for their valuable insights. I wanted to
          understand why the challenge frustrated them, what features they desired in a time calculation tool, and
          whether such a tool was even necessary. After a week of working on the project, I felt it was ready for user
          testing, although not yet ready for an official release. I managed to gather a group of seven individuals who
          were willing to test the tool, and the results were mixed. Some players raised concerns, suggesting that I
          might be reinventing the wheel or even attempting to copy Clash Ninja. To address these concerns and ensure I
          wasn't stepping on anyone's toes, I reached out to them on Discord and engaged in a conversation about my
          project. I reassured them that my intentions were solely to develop my own tool and that their website had
          inspired me to do so. To my relief, they were excited to hear about my project and supported its development.
        </p>
        <p>With the valuable feedback received from the testing phase, I felt confident enough to release a full version
          of the tool. I published it on Reddit, and once again, the reception was mixed. However, I took the
          opportunity to explain the intentions and specific use of the tool to the community. After understanding its
          purpose, people began to appreciate and receive the tool well.
        </p>
        <h5>What lessons were learned?</h5>
        <p>
          In total, over 250 people used the tool. Several people
          thanked me for the work that I put into the tool because they were able to motivate themselves to finish it
          because they
          didn't realize how close they were. It was a difficult but fun personal project that allowed me to understand
          the importance of market research. One of my favorite topics in Economics is that of
          <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Externalities.html">externalities.</a> Externalities, both
          positive and negative,
          can show us our effectiveness in planning. Some are unavoidable, but, some aren't and can be addressed with
          proper planning.
          The lesson from this project is to always conduct research before making a major decision. Engagning with
          others
          provides additional perspectives to the difficulties that could lie ahead.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, I made sure that this project was not done the 'easy way.' I made this project more difficult
          by using VLookup tables, dropdown lists, and multiple sheets which made it difficult to transfer between at
          times. I wanted to learn Excel, so, I found the topics that are used most in Financial Analysis. It said that
          Vlookup, conditional formatting with an added key, connections between sheets, indexes and matches, sumif and
          sumifs, etc. This resource uses all of those with labeling for the important cells. This provides the optimal
          user experience because they don't have to navigate a bulky excel file. But, it doesn't let them go too
          quickly to ensure they don't miss any of the necessary input boxes.
