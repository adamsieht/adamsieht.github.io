      <h1>Education - University of Missouri - Columbia</h1>
      <h2>Bachelor of Science in Business Administration: Finance & Banking</h2>
      <p>University of Missouri, Earned May 2023</p>
      <p>As a recent graduate of the University of Missouri's College of Business Finance and Banking program.
        acquired a diverse range of skills essential to the field of finance.
        Through comprehensive coursework and practical projects, I developed
        proficiency in financial modeling, constructing mathematical models to
        analyze and forecast financial data.</p>
      <p>I also gained expertise in cash flow analysis, assessing the financial
        health of businesses and projects by evaluating cash inflows and outflows.
        Moreover, I learned to apply these skills in real-world scenarios, such as
        valuing investment opportunities and optimizing portfolio performance. At
        Mizzou, I had the opportunity to delve into the intricacies of financial
        modeling, mastering techniques to analyze complex financial data and make
        informed decisions.</p>

      <h2><strong>Bachelor of Science in Economics</strong></h2>
      <p>University of Missouri, Earned May 2023</p>
      <p>I'm recent graduate of the University of Missouri's College of Arts and Sciences!
        My academic journey has provided me with a profound appreciation for the
        intricate web of connections that shape decision-making processes. Exploring
        the fascinating world of economics, I developed a deep passion for understanding
        the underlying theories and reasoning behind diverse choices. Perhaps most fascinating,
        economics sheds light on the motivations and incentives that drive human behavior.</p>
      <p>One aspect that particularly captivated me was the pursuit of understanding the broader
        implications of economic decisions. I relished in exploring the theoretical frameworks
        that shape economic policy and studying the impact of different strategies on the well-being
        of individuals and communities. Through rigorous analysis and practical applications, I honed
        my skills in evaluating economic data, conducting robust research, and effectively communicating findings.</p>

        <h3>Inventory optimization and strategy with Spirit of '76:</h3>
        <p>I worked with Spirit of '76 in the Summer of 2022. It was a unique
          time for the industry due to covid-19. In 2020, sales were at a near 5
          year low. In 2021, sales reached a record high, and in 2022, we didn't
          know what to expect. Planning during this period was difficult. We had
          expectations that sales would be higher than the previous year but
          only through careful planning. I worked with the Tent Manager to
          provide data-driven inventory orders with a few constraints. The focus
          was to optimize profit. In certain product categories we needed to
          minimize space prodcut took up. In others, we had to ensure we could
          sell enough of the high priced items to justify the cost.</p>

            Time Calculator</a></h3>
        <p>I have played the mobile game Clash of Clans since it's release over ten years ago (and that makes me feel
          super old). In October 17, a new base was released. Supercell dubbed it the Builder Base. It has separate
          progression, and eventually, they added an additional builder that could travel between both of the bases.
          This was instrumental because builders are precious. It allows users to progress through the game 20% faster.
          However, it was a long journey to progress through the builder base to eventually unlock the next builder.
          Players knew it was long, boring, and exhausting. The playerbase did not enjoy the builder base but some
          realized that unlocking the sixth builder, for free, was worth it.</p>
        <p>The steps required for the O.T.T.O. hut are to "gear up" three buildings in the home base, to upgrade the
          cannon cart to level 18, the mega tesla to level 9, and the battlemachine to level 30. Doesn't sound too tough
          right? Wrong. The reason behind the grind is the lack of resources within the builder base. Sure, you have a
          few collectors. They will contribute towards your progress but the main bulk of the resources come from
          winning attacks. You must win three attacks per day to maximize your resources. The battle rewards change
          depending on the trophy count of the player. But, it requires active play to progress through the base.</p>
        <p>Planning is a central element in Clash of Clans. Managing resources to ensure builders are being used
          efficiently is important. Players use tools like <a href="clashninja">clash ninja</a> to plan out the use of
          their resources. Clash ninja is a fantastic tool that I use myself, but, I realized it did not have a strong
          system for tracking builder base completion. So, I got to work building a tool that would help me understand
          how much more I need to progress to get to that unlock.</p>
        <p>At the time, I was a Junior in college. I had taken several classes that taught students how to use Excel.
          Similiar to this website project, I wanted to get a stronger understanding of different tools that I will have
          the opportunity to work with. I took the challenge to create a calculator that would estimate the time
          required to complete the builder hut. I started by gathering the data from a community website <a
            href="https://clashofclans.fandom.com/wiki/Clash_of_Clans_Wiki">clash wiki</a>. Clash wiki had the data
          tables with prices and durations for the upgrades.</p>
        <p>I spent a lot of time cleaning the data and ensuring the values are set to the correct units. Time for
          example, had several formats. For shorter upgrades the time was in minutes. For longer upgrades, the format
          for time was a combination of days and hours. Overall, it required a significant portion of the project's
          time.</p>
          <p>I used Excel VLookup tools to create dropdowns to set the values for each user. I also used this system to reference data in the data tables for my formulas. This portion of the project was the "heavy lifting" of the project that required the most thought. Players select the level for their current upgrade they are working on for each of the requirements. After their selection, various cells will also change. The tool shows data for the next upgrade cost, the time it will take to complete the upgrade, and the cumulative time and resources required to upgrade the building to the required level for the challenge.</p>
          <p>I wanted this to be a community driven project because I knew that I was not alone in my frustration. I knew that players could be empowered to complete the challenge if they had a better understanding of how long it would take. The frustration only lies in part with the challenge but the majority of the frustration comes from not knowing the length of the challenge. A player provided a comparison that shed light on how they saw this problem. "It's frustrating because I don't know how long it will take to finish it you know? It's the same reason I hate going to the emergency room. When you don't know how long it will take until you will get out of the waiting room and its just agonizing."</p>
          <p>I talked with the Clash of Clans reddit community and asked them about why the challenge frustrates them, what features they would like in a tool that calculates time needed, and if they needed a tool at all. I had been working on the project for a week and was not ready to release it, but ready for users to test it. I found a group of seven people that wanted to test it out and I got mixed results. Some players argued that I was reinventing the wheel, potentially even wondering if I was trying to copy Clash Ninja. I reached out to them on Discord and talked to them about my project to make sure I wasn't stepping on any toes. They were excited to hear that their website encouraged me to develop my own tool.</p>
          <p>The feedback gave me what I needed to release a full version of the tool. I published it on Reddit and </p>
